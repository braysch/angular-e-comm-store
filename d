    Finished the third video. Boy was this a doozy. The product object is more complex than the other objects because it includes a Brand object and a Category object and an array of images. I am running into an issue where when I edit a Product, the category and brand information are not autopopulated and it has yet to be solved!

    At minute 25 in video 3. Created the product object and hooked it up to database. Can do everything other objects can (add, delete, edit.) Used up all internet time in cafe. Products have more attributes than other objects and we need to display the relevant ones in the UI next time.

    Finished video 2. Introduced the brand component. This was quicker than the first because I mostly just copied everything over from category.

    Created category routes and handlers for creating, editing, and deleting categories via http requests. Did work on front-end to request data from database and display it to the screen. Next step: making add button functional. Timestamp 1:24:30 on video.
